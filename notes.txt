-- PHOTO EDIT PAGE --

Do we want users to be able to edit all their photos / poems at once? We could play around with an ejs template that allows users to see all the fields for all of their photos / poems on one page. 

There are definitely still some bugs on this page that need to be worked out, but it is working for now.
