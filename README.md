# MyCanvas
Every person is a collection of their stories. Tell yours!


Users should be able to create their canvas page.

They should have the option to add music, photos and poems.

Users can choose what to share on the community canvas.

Users can view other pages but only edit their own.


We will create four pages home, edit, community canvas and myCanvas

We will use three models and a music API
